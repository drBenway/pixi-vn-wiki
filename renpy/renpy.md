# Ren'Py Language Integration

Pixi’VN gives you the ability to write your own narrative using Ren'Py Language.

## What is Ren'Py Language?

Ren'Py Language is a scripting language for writing interactive narrative. It is used in games like Doki Doki Literature Club, Katawa Shoujo, and Long Live the Queen to create branching stories.

Ren'Py Language is used in Ren'Py, a visual novel engine that helps you to create visual novels and story-based games. You can learn more about it on the [Ren'Py website](https://www.renpy.org/).

## Why use Ren'Py integration?

Programming a game narrative in **Javascript/Typescript** has the advantage of having total development freedom, but the disadvantage is that it slows down the writing of a narrative (it makes you write a lot of code).

## Ren'Py integration is in development
