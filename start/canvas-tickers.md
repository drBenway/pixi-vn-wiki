# Tickers (primitive animations and effects)

Pixi’VN provides the possibility to animate the canvas components with the Tickers (primitive animations and effects).

The Tickers, compared to `PixiJS.tickers`, are a class with a `fn` method that is executed on each frame. This method is used to animate the canvas components. Pixi’VN keeps track of all running Tickers, detects when they are no longer used and allows you to pause, resume, and delete them with [various methods](/start/canvas-tickers-functions.md).

Pixi’VN provides various primitive Tickers, that can be used to perform basic actions. For example, the `MoveTicker` class is primitive animation that can be used to move a canvas component. They are classes that extend the [Ticker](/start/canvas-tickers-functions).

## Move

For moving a canvas component in `(x, y)` direction you can use the `MoveTicker` class.
This Ticker will edit the `x` and `y` properties to reach the destination.

`MoveTicker` have a constructor that takes the a object with the following properties:

* `destination`: is an object that contains the destination of the movement. It has the following properties:
  * `x`: is a number that represents the destination in the x direction.
  * `y`: is a number that represents the destination in the y direction.
  * `type` (Optional): is a string that represents the type of the destination. Possible values are `pixel`, `percentage` and `align`:
    * `pixel`: The destination is in pixel.
    * `percentage`: The destination is in percentage.
    * `align`: The destination is in align.
    default is `pixel`.
* `speed` (Optional): is a number that represents the speed of the movement.
* `speedProgression` (Optional): in case the movement needs to increase/decrease in speed over time, this property can be used. You can read more about it [here](#speed-progression-property).
* `startOnlyIfHaveTexture` (Optional): is a boolean that represents if the animation should start only if the canvas component have a texture not empty. If `true` and the canvas component not have a texture, the animation will not edit the `x` and `y` properties, but will be executed. You can read more about it [here](#start-only-if-have-texture-property).
* `aliasToRemoveAfter` (Optional): is a string[] that contains the aliases of the [canvas component](/start/canvas-components) that will be removed after the movement. You can read more about it [here](#alias-to-remove-after-property).
* `tickerAliasToResume` (Optional): in case you want to continue some tickers that were previously paused, you can pass the aliases of the canvas components that have the tickers to be resumed. You can read more about it [here](#ticker-alias-to-resume-property).

## Rotate

For rotating a canvas component you can use the `RotateTicker` class.
This Ticker will edit the `rotation` property to rotate the canvas component.

`RotateTicker` have a constructor that takes the a object with the following properties:

* `speed` (Optional): is a number that represents the speed of the rotation.
* `clockwise` (Optional): is a boolean that represents the direction of the rotation. If `true`, the rotation will be clockwise, otherwise it will be counterclockwise.

* `startOnlyIfHaveTexture` (Optional): is a boolean that represents if the animation should start only if the canvas component have a texture not empty. If `true` and the canvas component not have a texture, the animation will not edit the `rotation` property, but will be executed. You can read more about it [here](#start-only-if-have-texture-property).
* `aliasToRemoveAfter` (Optional): is a string[] that contains the aliases of the [canvas component](/start/canvas-components) that will be removed after the movement. You can read more about it [here](#alias-to-remove-after-property).

## Special properties

All the Tickers have the following properties:

### Speed progression property

You can use the `speedProgression` property to increase/decrease the speed of the effect over time.

Existent types are `linear` and `exponential`. The `linear` type will increase the speed by a fixed amount every frame, while the `exponential` type will increase the speed by a percentage every frame.

The `speedProgression` property is an object that contains the following properties:

* `type`: is a string that represents the type of the progression. Possible values are `linear` and `exponential`.

If the `type` is `linear`, the object must contain the following properties:

* `amt`: is a number that represents the amount of the speed to increase every frame.
* `limit` (Optional): is a number that represents the limit of the effect.

If the `type` is `exponential`, the object must contain the following properties:

* `percentage`: is a number that represents the percentage of the speed to increase every frame. If the percentage is `0.1`, the speed will increase by `10%` every frame.
* `limit` (Optional): is a number that represents the limit of the effect.

### Start only if have texture property

You can use the `startOnlyIfHaveTexture` property to start the animation only if the canvas component have a texture not empty. This is actually during the [creation of a transition](/start/canvas-transition.md#create-your-own-transition).

### Alias to remove after property

You can use the `aliasToRemoveAfter` property to remove the canvas component after the effect. This is actually during the [creation of a transition](/start/canvas-transition.md#create-your-own-transition).

### Ticker alias to resume property

You can use the `tickerAliasToResume` property to resume some tickers that were previously paused. `tickerAliasToResume` is an array of strings that contains the aliases of the canvas components that have the tickers to be resumed.

## Create a Ticker

In Pixi.js, you can add a Ticker by passing a lambda as a parameter that will be executed on each frame.

In Pixi’VN, you must create a class tha extends `TickerBase`, add a decorator `@tickerDecorator` to the class and override the `fn` method.

`@tickerDecorator` is a decorator that save the ticker in memory. It have a optional parameter that is the id of the ticker (must be unique). If you don't pass the id, the ticker will be saved with the class name. ( [How enable the decorators in TypeScript?](/start/getting-started#how-enable-the-decorators-in-typescript) )

```typescript
@tickerDecorator() // or @tickerDecorator('RotateTicker')
export default class RotateTicker extends TickerBase<{ speed?: number, clockwise?: boolean }> {
    override fn(
        t: Ticker,
        args: {
            speed?: number,
            clockwise?: boolean,
        },
        aliases: string[]
    ): void {
        let speed = args.speed === undefined ? 0.1 : args.speed
        let clockwise = args.clockwise === undefined ? true : args.clockwise
        aliases.forEach((alias) => {
            let component = canvas.find(alias)
            if (component && component instanceof Container) {
                if (clockwise)
                    component.rotation += speed * t.deltaTime
                else
                    component.rotation -= speed * t.deltaTime
            }
        })
    }
}
```
