**What is [Spine 2D](https://it.esotericsoftware.com/)?** Spine 2D is a powerful 2D animation software specifically designed for game development. It utilizes a skeletal animation system, meaning that characters and objects are animated using a hierarchy of "bones" that control the movement of attached parts.

Having the ability to use elements with advanced animations can be very useful in many cases.

The [spine-pixi](https://it.esotericsoftware.com/spine-pixi) library provides this capability to PixiJS.
