# Assets

**What are assets?** The assets are all the files that are not code, such as images, sounds, and videos.

You can use assets saved locally in the project or online (For the second option you will need to make sure that the cloud service you are using allows *CORS requests*). Of course, if your assets are online, a requirement of the game will be to be connected online. Then you will have to notify the user and block the game where there is no connection.

If you are creating a visual novel, it is recommended to only keep assets that are used frequently locally. While, for assets used only once in the game, it is recommended to publish them online.

To load and manipulate assets (images, gifs, videos...) you will need to use `Assets`. `Assets` is a class with many features and comes from the PixiJS library, if you want more information read [here](https://pixijs.com/8.x/guides/components/assets). It is also very important that you read this documentation to better [organize the uploading of your assets](/start/assets-management.md).

You mainly have two choices for where to save your assets, local or online.

## Local assets

To save and use assets locally, you can use any folder, there are no restrictions. But it is recommended to use the `assets` folder. Inside this folder you can create subfolders to better organize your assets.

Here is an example of how to import and load an asset into your project:

```ts [/utils/assets.ts]
import { Assets } from "@drincs/pixi-vn";
import bg01hallway from "../assets/images/bg01-hallway.webp";

/**
 * Define all the assets that will be used in the game.
 * This function will be called before the game starts.
 * You can read more about assets management in the documentation: https://pixi-vn.web.app/start/assets-management.html
 */
export async function defineAssets() {
    Assets.add({
        alias: "bg01-hallway",
        src: bg01hallway,
    });
}
```

AssetPack is a tool for optimising local assets for the web. It can be used to transform, combine, compress assets.

If you want to use AssetPack, you can find the documentation [here](https://pixijs.io/assetpack)

## Assets hosting

You can save your assets online. This is a good option if you want to save space on your computer. You can use any cloud service that allows you to upload files and generate a public URL (CORS enabled).

Here is an example of how to import and load an asset into your project:

```ts [/utils/assets.ts]
import { Assets } from "@drincs/pixi-vn";

/**
 * Define all the assets that will be used in the game.
 * This function will be called before the game starts.
 * You can read more about assets management in the documentation: https://pixi-vn.web.app/start/assets-management.html
 */
export async function defineAssets() {
    Assets.add({
        alias: "bg01-hallway",
        src: "https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/pixi-vn.appspot.com/o/public%2Fbreakdown%2Fbg01-hallway.webp?alt=media",
    });
}
```
